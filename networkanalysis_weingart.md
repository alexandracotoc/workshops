### Who are you?
Name
Where you're from.
What is your interest in networks?

### Google

Poor results. Thought of the internert as a network.
Based on citation network.


### What is a network?

ex. London Underground
ex. Facebook / Food Web/ Citation Network / Electrical Grid

All have particular properties. 
Ex. Electrical Grid going down in US in 2000s. Spread to power outage throughout the northeast.

graph/network used interchangably

Network science independently created by a lot of different disciplines.

### Edge Attributes

Directed/ Asymmetric or Undirected/ Symmetric  (ex. Twitter -> Follow or not Follow vs Facebook)
Weighted or Unweighted (Amount of time two actors share together)
Types (Different kinds of connections)

### Node Attributes
Gender/Location/  Start and End Time / Age/ Title/ Salary/ etc

### Dyads and Triads
Building blocks of networks.

###Transitivity & Triadic Closure
If A is conect to be and B is connected to C, likely C will connect to A.

### Isolates

### Bipartite Networks

Nodes of different sorts conencted to each other.  People and Organizations connected. 
Unlikely to have isolate because fundamentally interested in relationships.

### K - Partite Networks 
Ex. Author - Title - Publisher 
Nodes of different sorts conencted to each other.

### Parallel Edges & Self-Loops
Gephi can't handle Parallel Edges. You can turn it into a weight in Gephi though. Ex. I call Scott, Scott calls me.
If different types of edges, need to analyze seperate them into different networks.
More recent work is helping with this. Not in the tools.

Network algorithms aren't great with self-loops.

### Huamanities Networks
- Moretti - Network Plot Analysis Article
- Russian River Network - Moscow had highest betweeness centrality.
- Florentine Families (Padgett & Ansell 1993) (Read!) No math. Just visualization.
- Charachter Network (Graham Sack 2012) - charachter co-occurance networks. Literary trends.
- Body in Folklore (Weingart & Jorgensen 2013 - "Representations of Gender and the Body in European Folktales")
